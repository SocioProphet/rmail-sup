Friday Funny--or Friday Weirdness perhaps...

But this is not entirely an off topic post.  It touchs on current =
events, but more to the point, this website (described in the attached =
article) presents a complex and innovative method of creating an online =
exhibit for an archive of very diverse materials, in this case, about =
Arnold Schwarzenegger. =20

http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/ioa/arnold/arnoldwebpages/arnold.htm

It is the work of a couple of serious academic scholars, tho some might =
take this as evidence that what goes on in academe these days is =
hopelessly mired in pop-culture triviality, esoteric solipsism (or do I =
mean solipsistic esotericism?), obsessive compulsion, and nonsense.  =
Perhaps a year ago, one could make that argument.  I don't think it =
would be quite so easy to say that now--no matter what the outcome of =
next week's election. =20

HEADLINE:  Arnold hits the halls of academe; Two scholars have a curious =

    specialty: Schwarzenegger studies.---- Alan Zarembo
SOURCE: Los Angeles Times via Factiva
                TEXT:
SANTA FE, N.M.

Standing before a roomful of fellow PhDs, Louise Krasneiwicz wears an =
untucked=20
    beach shirt -- a multihued collage of musclemen and "championship"=20
    banners. Perched on a chair near her podium is a poster from Flex =
magazine=20
    featuring a bare-chested Arnold Schwarzenegger from his bodybuilding =
days.

"We think that Arnold Schwarzenegger's extensive influence and =
remarkable=20
    presence in late 20th century American culture has gone beyond=20
    inspiration, hero worship and entertainment," she tells the captive=20
    audience at the School of American Research here, where she is a =
research=20
    associate.

Many of the social scientists take notes.

Schwarzenegger has been many things in his life: immigrant, =
weightlifter,=20
    action movie star and now gubernatorial candidate. A less known role =
has=20
    been academic study subject.

For the last two decades, Krasneiwicz, a cultural anthropologist, and =
her=20
    intellectual partner, Michael Blitz, the tenured chair of "thematic=20
    studies" at John Jay College in New York, have examined his role in=20
    popular culture. To the bewilderment of some peers, they have =
collected=20
    hundreds of articles and advertisements with references to =
Schwarzenegger,=20
    attended the bodybuilding competition he sponsors, taped the sounds =
inside=20
    his restaurant bathroom, watched his 30-plus movies dozens of times =
--=20
    including rare finds like the 1980 TV drama "The Jayne Mansfield =
Story,"=20
    co-starring Loni Anderson. (Arnold played Mickey Hargitay.)

It has been a pursuit so consuming that they regularly dream about their =

    subject -- and have posted more than 150 of those dreams, ranging =
from the=20
    bizarre to the erotic, on their Web site (Google search: "dreaming=20
    arnold").

Avowed postmodernists, the researchers say the point of their collection =
is=20
    not to quantify Schwarzenegger's influence as a cultural icon -- =
though=20
    they do contend that his importance far exceeds that of any other =
living=20
    celebrity -- but to arrive at some vision of America.

"We're not really interested in studying him as a person but as a =
reference, a=20
    point in our culture," Krasneiwicz says.

She has many examples. An issue of Lingua Franca includes an article =
called=20
    "Terminating Analysis," a profile of the "Schwarzenegger of=20
    Freud-bashers." An automobile advertisement declares that "The Dodge =
Viper=20
    is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of sports cars." A Time magazine piece =
on=20
    pectoral implants proclaims the "Schwarzeneggerization of society." =
A Los=20
    Angeles Times piece on HIV research refers to the "Arnold =
Schwarzeneggers=20
    of science."

In other words, the references go far beyond weightlifting or Hollywood. =

    Schwarzenegger has become "a prototype of power, influence, =
connection, of=20
    getting things done," Krasneiwicz says.

She and Blitz were fellow doctoral students at the State University of =
New=20
    York at Albany in the mid-1980s, the same era that "Hasta la vista, =
baby"=20
    joined the American lexicon. Schwarzenegger became a bridge between =
their=20
    disciplines (anthropology and English), the topic of a long-running=20
    conversation and the cement of their friendship.

By 1990, Krasneiwicz had moved to UCLA and Blitz to John Jay College, =
and=20
    their interest in Schwarzenegger had become a mild obsession.

Los Angeles, of course, was the ideal place to observe the man himself.=20
    Krasneiwicz often spotted him -- pulling into traffic in his Hummer; =
in a=20
    neighborhood pumpkin patch with his wife, Maria Shriver, and their=20
    children; at a Santa Monica shopping mall shooting a scene for =
"Terminator=20
    2: Judgment Day."

On that occasion, she managed to snap several shots of Schwarzenegger =
before=20
    security guards ordered her to leave.

"It was a great chance to watch people watching Arnold," she says.

Nobody, though, could keep her out of the bathroom at Schatzi on Main, =
the=20
    Santa Monica restaurant Schwarzenegger once ran. She recorded the =
sound=20
    that was piped into the restroom -- a taped lesson in German, the =
actor's=20
    native tongue.

The star's domain, of course, extends far beyond California. In 1991,=20
    Krasneiwicz and Blitz flew to Columbus, Ohio, for the "Third Annual =
Arnold=20
    Schwarzenegger Classic," a bodybuilding competition. There they =
employed=20
    the classic anthropological technique of "participant observation," =
paying=20
    $50 each to join a long line of fans waiting for Polaroid =
photographs with=20
    Schwarzenegger.

Watching the people swarm around Schwarzenegger, they realized that he =
was=20
    more than a celebrity. One woman who had been injured in a car =
accident=20
    thanked him for her recovery.

"Everybody had something to say about their attraction to Arnold," says =
Blitz.=20
    "A lot of people spoke about him very familiarly even though they =
never=20
    met him."

Their Arnold sensors on alert, the academic pair kept hearing more =
Arnold=20
    references. In a grocery store, Krasneiwicz overheard a man =
advocating a=20
    halt to illegal immigration by building a massive fence -- "one that =
even=20
    Arnold Schwarzenegger could not climb on a good day."

After her son was born in 1995, Krasneiwicz started noticing references =
in=20
    children's videos. In one featuring construction equipment, the =
talking=20
    machines have Schwarzenegger accents.

On a sleeper train to Pittsburgh, when Blitz assisted a frail old man=20
    struggling to set up his bed, the man complimented him: "You must be =

    related to that Schwarzenegger fellow."

"He's like mold that grows everywhere," says Blitz.

The actor as metaphor

It would be easy to dismiss the academic duo as mere Schwarzenegger =
fanatics.=20
    After all, there are dozens of fan Web sites devoted to him. But =
have=20
    those fans published book chapters titled "The Replicator: Starring =
Arnold=20
    Schwarzenegger as the Great Meme-Machine"? Or presented a digital =
video=20
    called "The Ur'borg: Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Inhabitants of=20
    Post-Humanity" at a meeting of the American Anthropological =
Association?

Along the way they have rankled some fellow academics, and not only =
because=20
    they have broken tradition at formal conferences by handing out =
barbells=20
    or piping Schwarzenegger sound bites into the background.

Detractors of their work wonder what sets Schwarzenegger apart from =
other=20
    celebrities created and packaged by the movie, music or sports =
industries.=20
    "I would have liked to see more attention paid to the political =
economy of=20
    the images of Arnold," says xxxxxxxxx Cocks, a historian present at=20
    Krasnei- wicz's New Mexico talk. "Why are they so common? Who is =
putting=20
    them out there? What is the role of Hollywood?"

O.J. Simpson, Michael Jordan and Madonna are among many celebrities who =
rank=20
    ahead of Schwarzenegger in cultural weight, according to Douglas =
Kellner,=20
    a UCLA professor who writes about media and cultural studies and has =

    attended a "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" conference in Australia.

And while he concedes that Schwarzenegger has had a peculiar longevity =
in pop=20
    culture, he says, "Clint Eastwood is a much more significant figure =
than=20
    Arnold. And he's made some really good films. Academically I've seen =
some=20
    really good books on Clint Eastwood. I don't know of any books on=20
    Schwarzenegger."

Krasneiwicz and Blitz say they have one in the works. Admirers defend =
the work=20
    as a serious academic pursuit.

"If I went to Russia and I were doing research in a village and there =
was a=20
    local person who was like Arnold, an immigrant who married into one =
of the=20
    most influential families in Russia and who was a megastar in the =
country,=20
    I would have to find out about this person," says Liesl Gambold =
Miller, an=20
    anthropologist and former student of Krasneiwicz.

In any case, Schwarzeneggerology has long drawn guilty intrigue: "Each =
time=20
    I've had a job interview there is a reticent interest in =
Schwarzenegger,"=20
    Blitz says. "You get all these eggheads together. They want to know =
about=20
    your scholarship. But what they really want to know about is=20
    Schwarzenegger."

>From opposite coasts, Krasneiwicz and Blitz have traded thoughts online, =

    making for some odd academic exchanges:

"Here's what I remember of the Arnold dream last night: I stabbed him in =
the=20
    belly with a pie spatula. That is all," she wrote on Sept. 26, 1996.

He responded the next day: "I heard some radio-head commentator say, =
about=20
    Yeltsin, 'Y'know, he's not exactly the Arnold Schwarzenegger of =
world=20
    leaders.' "

Both Krasneiwicz and Blitz have a wide range of interests and =
publications.=20
    But the California recall election has given sudden relevance to =
their=20
    studies of Schwarzenegger after a few years of relative quiet. When=20
    Schwarzenegger announced on television his decision to run, =
Krasneiwicz=20
    captured the moment on her VCR. Then she celebrated: "Thank you, =
Arnold.=20
    You just provided me with material for the next 20 years."

On the rise are calls from reporters, usually dismayed that Krasneiwicz =
has=20
    only cultural theory to offer, and no dirt.

Arnold "seems to embody the idea that you can always get from point A to =
point=20
    B to point C with toughness, omnipresence, constant marketing, =
rhetoric=20
    that sticks in your mouth, physical appearance," says Blitz.

That specter of possibility and simplicity, the academics believe, is =
his=20
    greatest asset in the recall campaign.

It could help explain why Schwarzenegger has agreed to only one debate =
(for=20
    which he was given the questions in advance) and has granted few=20
    interviews to political journalists. To stake out a position on an =
issue=20
    is to restrict our sense of his possibility -- and maybe hurt his =
chances=20
    in the race to replace the tenacious Gov. Gray Davis, who himself =
has not=20
    escaped comparison with Schwarzenegger's most famous character.

In 1997, The Times asked Cruz Bustamante, now the leading Democratic =
candidate=20
    in the recall race, about Davis' gubernatorial prospects.

The response? "He's a machine. He is difficult to stop.... You blow him =
up and=20
    he just keeps on going. Strip him of all his flesh and he keeps =
coming."

In other words, said Bustamante, "He's like the Terminator."     =
